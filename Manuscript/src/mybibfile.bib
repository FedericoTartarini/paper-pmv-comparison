    abstract = {Thermal comfort is fundamental to indoor environmental design and operation as well as indoor thermal environment evaluation. This paper has reviewed the historic evolution of thermal comfort research during the last century using a systematic approach and a particular focus on adaptive thermal comfort studies. A large number of published articles as well as standards and guides were collected and screened based on a rigorous search method to ensure the literature database was both focused and complete. A further evaluation of representative prediction models has been conducted by applying the models to a large database and comparing the differences in their performance. Based on the review analysis, three representative thermal environment assessment approaches were classified as the heat balance approach, the adaptive regression-based approach and the adaptive heat balance approach. The strengths and constraints of each approach were analyzed. Comparisons of different models in the adaptive heat balance approach were conducted using the ASHRAE databases I\&II. Thermal comfort theory and approaches have been developed which underpin standards and guidelines in building and engineering system design, operation and evaluation though there are pros and cons of different methods. The heat balance approach features the detailed parameters of design criteria of indoor thermal environments. The adaptive regression-based approach played an important role in raising awareness of adaptive capacities and paved the way towards first implementations into standardization. The adaptive heat balance approach combines the heat balance and the adaptive regression approaches and leads towards future improvements in adaptive comfort modelling. It demonstrates very good performance and its inclusive approach offers potential for further breakthroughs in reducing the limitations of the existing methods.},

    abstract = {Heat exchange processes between the body and the environment are introduced. The definition of the thermoneutral zone as the ambient temperature range within which body temperature (Tb) regulation is achieved only by nonevaporative processes is explained. Thermoreceptors, thermoregulatory effectors (both physiologic and behavioral), and neural pathways and Tb signals that connect receptors and effectors into a thermoregulation system are reviewed. A classification of thermoeffectors is proposed. A consensus concept is presented, according to which the thermoregulation system is organized as a dynamic federation of independent thermoeffector loops. While the activity of each effector is driven by a unique combination of deep (core) and superficial (shell) Tbs, the regulated variable of the system can be viewed as a spatially distributed Tb with a heavily represented core and a lightly represented shell. Core Tb is the main feedback; it is always negative. Shell Tbs (mostly of the hairy skin) represent the auxiliary feedback, which can be negative or positive, and which decreases the system’s response time and load error. Signals from the glabrous (nonhairy) skin about the temperature of objects in the environment serve as feedforward signals for various behaviors. Physiologic effectors do not use feedforward signals. The system interacts with other homeostatic systems by “meshing” with their loops. Coordination between different thermoeffectors is achieved through the common controlled variable, Tb. The term balance point (not set point) is used for a regulated level of Tb. The term interthreshold zone is used for a Tb range in which no effectors are activated. Thermoregulatory states are classified, based on whether: Tb is increased (hyperthermia) or decreased (hypothermia); the interthreshold zone is narrow (homeothermic type of regulation) or wide (poikilothermic type); and the balance point is increased (fever) or decreased (anapyrexia). During fever, thermoregulation can be either homeothermic or poikilothermic; anapyrexia is always a poikilothermic state. The biologic significance of poikilothermic states is discussed. As an example of practical applications of the concept presented, thermopharmacology is reviewed. Thermopharmacology uses drugs to modulate specific temperature signals at the level of a thermoreceptor (transient receptor potential channel).},

Distributions of air temperature excess and air speed were measured in the thermal plume 0.70 m (2.30 ft) above each of the simulators. The results show that the thermal plume generated by the dummy comprising head, torso, and legs has a similar shape of the cross-section and integral characteristics to the manikin plume; therefore, the dummy can successfully be used as a simulator of a sitting person. Simple shaped models of a sitting human without a clear indication of legs, such as a cylinder and a rectangular box, are not recommended for use. The plume of the cylinder is symmetrical and concentrated, while the plume above the rectangular box is sensitive to the surroundings and can have two maximums of air speed distribution.},

The exercise began with a systematic collection and harmonization of raw data from the last two decades of thermal comfort field studies around the world. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II (Comfort Database), now an online, open-source database, includes approximately 81,846 complete sets of objective indoor climatic observations with accompanying “right-here-right-now” subjective evaluations by the building occupants who were exposed to them. The database is intended to support diverse inquiries about thermal comfort in field settings. A simple web-based interface to the database enables filtering on multiple criteria, including building typology, occupancy type, subjects' demographic variables, subjective thermal comfort states, indoor thermal environmental criteria, calculated comfort indices, environmental control criteria and outdoor meteorological information. Furthermore, a web-based interactive thermal comfort visualization tool has been developed that allows end-users to quickly and interactively explore the data.},

    abstract = {The predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) are the most widely used thermal comfort indices. Yet, their performance remains a contested topic. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II, the largest of its kind, was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the PMV/PPD model. We focused on: (i) the accuracy of PMV in predicting both observed thermal sensation (OTS) or observed mean vote (OMV) and (ii) comparing the PMV-PPD relationship with binned OTS – observed percentage of unacceptability (OPU). The accuracy of PMV in predicting OTS was only 34 {\%} , meaning that the thermal sensation is incorrectly predicted two out of three times. PMV had a mean absolute error of one unit on the thermal sensation scale and its accuracy decreased towards the ends of the thermal sensation scale. The accuracy of PMV was similarly low for air-conditioned, naturally ventilated and mixed-mode buildings. In addition, the PPD was not able to predict the dissatisfaction rate. If the PMV model would perfectly predict thermal sensation, then PPD accuracy is higher close to neutrality but it would overestimate dissatisfaction by approximately 15–25 {\%} outside of it. Furthermore, PMV-PPD accuracy varied strongly between ventilation strategies, building types and climate groups. These findings demonstrate the low prediction accuracy of the PMV–PPD model, indicating the need to develop high prediction accuracy thermal comfort models. For demonstration, we developed a simple thermal prediction model just based on air temperature and its accuracy, for this database, was higher than PMV.},

By integrating both natural ventilation and mechanical cooling strategies, mixed-mode (or hybrid) building operation is able to achieve comfortable indoor environments whilst minimising reliance on energy intensive HVAC systems. This study investigated how different modes of operation in a mixed-mode building - air-conditioning (AC) and natural ventilation (NV) - affect indoor thermal environmental conditions and occupant perceptions of thermal comfort. Longitudinal field observations were made in a mixed-mode building located in subtropical climate area of Australia. Continuous indoor environmental quality (IEQ) data and building operational data such as HVAC system and windows states were collected, alongside right-here-right-now occupant comfort surveys. Time-and-place matching of these objective and subjective data streams enabled analysis of the relationships between building operational modes, indoor thermal environments, and occupant perception of comfort. The results indicate that the mode of ventilation influenced comfort responses of occupants beyond the direct effects of different thermal conditions. Occupants of the mixed mode building were more tolerant of, or adaptive to, the indoor thermal conditions when the building was in the NV mode of operation compared to the AC operational mode. Participants more actively thermoregulated their clothing insulation (clo) than what was predicted by the ASHRAE Standard 55′s dynamic clothing model. These findings support the call for extending the scope of applicability of adaptive comfort standards to include mixed-mode buildings.},

This article reports on a study to investigate thermal perceptions, preferences and adaptive behaviours of occupants in five nursing homes. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire while local environmental parameters were monitored in their near proximity using portable equipment. Not all the facilities in the study provided a thermally comfortable environment for occupants at all times, and indoor air temperatures were found to range between 17.2 °C and 31.6 °C over the course of the study. As a result, participants adopted a range of adaptive behaviours to compensate for unsatisfactory thermal comfort conditions, such as adjustment of their clothing and the use of ceiling and portable fans in summer. Residents were more tolerant of temperature variations than staff or visitors and both the estimated neutral and preferred temperatures were higher for residents than for non-residents. The findings of this study are likely to have practical implications for all the stakeholders in the aged care sector.

Pierce two-node model of human thermoregulation and the Fanger Comfort Equation - predict comfort responses of individuals exposed to thermal environments under conditions of either rest or exercise. This paper evaluates the ability of these two models to predict the physiological variables underlying thermal comfort over a wide range of still air environments (effective temperature between 5°C and 45°C) and exercise intensities (rest to 85\% of maximal aerobic capacity). The physiological data base used for comparison was taken from several published and as-yet unpublished studies at three different laboratories. Values of core temperature (TCR), skin temperature (TSK) and skin wettedness predicted by the Pierce two-node model, and PMV, predicted by the Fanger model, differed significantly from observed values (P{\textless}.05). The Pierce model tended to underestimate w (mean error = -.16) and TCR (mean error = -.31°C), and to overpredict TSK (mean error = .48°C). wettedness predictions were less accurate for high exercise intensity (6 to 8 met) than for rest, low exercise intensity (i to 3.5 met) or moderate exercise intensity (3.5 to 6 met). Accuracy was higher for males than females, and greater for females in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle than females in the luteal phase. Errors in TSK predictions were also associated with exercise intensity but not associated with either gender or effective temperature. TCR predictions were significantly more accurate for females than for males. The average error associated with PMV predictions was 1.26 scaling units and was related to both effective temperature (ET*) and exercise intensity. Based on multiple linear regression with and exercise intensity, the expected error in PMV was approximately zero at ET=28°C for resting subjects. The magnitude of error increased by approximately .3 scaling units for each l°C change in ET, and by approximately 1.3 scaling units for each increase in exercise intensity level (e.g. rest to low).},

To evaluate the performance of a brushless direct current (DC) stand fan, the cooling fan efficiency (CFE) index was measured in a climatic chamber under four dry-bulb temperatures (24, 26, 28, and 30 °C), six speed settings (corresponding to centreline speeds in the range 0.6–2.5 m/s at 1 m distance), two fan-manikin distances (1 and 2 m) and two orientations (front, side). The CFE index is defined as the ratio of the whole-body cooling effect generated by non-uniform airflow from the fan to its power consumption (°C/W). The CFE index overcomes the limitations of assessing the cooling effect based just on a few air speed measurements. The results show that the CFE index is influenced by dry-bulb temperature, fan speed setting, and fan-manikin distance, but not by fan-manikin orientation. The lower the temperature and the closer the fan, the higher is the CFE index. Increasing fan speed setting simultaneously enhances whole-body cooling and increases power use. Consequently, the CFE has a non-monotonic relationship with fan speed setting and the peak value is reached for an intermediate speed. As compared with previous testing results using an alternating current stand fan, the CFE index of the DC fan we tested is three times higher. As a complement to air-conditioning, the tested stand fan is a suitable energy-efficient technology for providing thermal comfort in warm environments.},

    abstract = {Moving air has long been used to provide comfort in warm environments. Provision for indoor air movement was one of the wellsprings of traditional architectural design in warm regions, affecting building form, components, and equipment over millennia. However, this design option has faded from practice since the advent of air-conditioning, in which the focus has been on controlling temperature and humidity. Despite the fact that air movement can be an energy efficient alternative to air cooling, it became viewed more as a possible source of undesirable draft, and comfort standards came to set room airspeed limits very low, even for temperatures as warm as 26ºC (79ºF). An exception was granted if the airspeed source was under personal individual control, such as a window in a private office, or a desk fan, but only above 26 ºC (79ºF).},

	abstract = {In ASHRAE Standard 55-2010, the comfort effects of elevated air movement are evaluated using the SET index as computed by the Gagge 2-Node model of whole-body heat balance. Air movement in reality has many forms, which might create heat flows and thermal sensations that cannot be accurately predicted by a simple whole-body model. This paper addresses two of such potential inaccuracies: 1) indoor airflows may affect only a portion of the body surface (e.g., above desktop), and the affected body surface might be variably nude (e.g., face) or clothed, 2) the turbulence intensity (TI) in some typical airstreams (e.g., those created by fans) might have a different impact on heat transfer than the TI implicit in 2-Node's single convective heat transfer coefficient. For both these issues, can a whole-body index like SET represent such a wide range of possible exposures to airflow? Measurements of thermal sensation were obtained from human subjects using face-level fans in warm environments. Previous laboratory studies of a range of airstream sources were also analyzed. The effects of turbulence intensity were examined with manikin tests. The results show that indices derived from the 2-Node model of whole-body heat balance are effective at predicting thermal sensation under most non-uniform air movement. In contrast, the PMV index underestimates cooling in warm conditions. Turbulence increases the cooling effect of air movement, but by amounts that might be neglected for most design purposes.},

It is noteworthy that the PMV value is greatly affected by the changes of its independent variables (air temperature, mean radiant temperature, air velocity, relative humidity, metabolic rate and clothing insulation); therefore the accuracy requirements of sensors for the measurement of environmental quantities as well the assessment of other parameters related to the activity and clothing appear a crucial matter. This work deals with a sensitivity analysis of PMV index to the accuracy of its six independent variables. Obtained results clearly show that the widths of PMV ranges ﬁxed for each class in 7730 are near to the PMV uncertainty related to measuring devices accuracy, making often the environment classiﬁcation a random operation.

This application is examined, using the ASHRAE database of ®eld-studies. Taking these worldwide data as a single distribution, PMV is free from serious bias. There exist, however, underlying biases in relation to all contributing variables, and a further bias related to the outdoor temperature. These biases often combine to produce a substantial bias in PMV. In surveys of individual buildings, PMVoften differs markedly and systematically from the actual mean vote, both for naturally ventilated (NV) and for air-conditioned (AC) spaces. Possible origins of the biases are discussed, and it is shown that it would be possible to modify PMV substantially to reduce them. Environmental consequences of the use of PMV are discussed. It is concluded that ISO 7730 in its present form can be seriously misleading when used to estimate thermal comfort conditions in buildings. # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {People's subjective response to any thermal environment is commonly investigated by using rating scales describing the degree of thermal sensation, comfort, and acceptability. Subsequent analyses of results collected in this way rely on the assumption that specific distances between verbal anchors placed on the scale exist and that relationships between verbal anchors from different dimensions that are assessed (e.g. thermal sensation and comfort) do not change. Another inherent assumption is that such scales are independent of the context in which they are used (climate zone, season, etc.). Despite their use worldwide, there is indication that contextual differences influence the way the scales are perceived and therefore question the reliability of the scales’ interpretation. To address this issue, a large international collaborative questionnaire study was conducted in 26 countries, using 21 different languages, which led to a dataset of 8225 questionnaires. Results, analysed by means of robust statistical techniques, revealed that only a subset of the responses are in accordance with the mentioned assumptions. Significant differences appeared between groups of participants in their perception of the scales, both in relation to distances of the anchors and relationships between scales. It was also found that respondents’ interpretations of scales changed with contextual factors, such as climate, season, and language. These findings highlight the need to carefully consider context-dependent factors in interpreting and reporting results from thermal comfort studies or post-occupancy evaluations, as well as to revisit the use of rating scales and the analysis methods used in thermal comfort studies to improve their reliability.},

    abstract = {Elevated air movement produced by fans can offset air-conditioning energy requirements by allowing temperature setpoints to be raised without compromising thermal comfort. These advantages are even greater in hot and humid climates that inherently have large and sustained indoor cooling requirements. Few studies have assessed the in-situ benefits of fans in actual buildings. We installed ceiling and desk fans into a Zero Energy office building (675 m2) in Singapore. Across an 11-week period, 35 occupants alternated between two conditions (no fan vs. fan): 24 °C setpoint with fans off, and 26.5 °C setpoint with fans on. When the temperature setpoint was raised and elevated air movement was provided, a 32\% energy reduction was obtained. The energy savings accrued without any negative impacts occurring on thermal satisfaction. Overcooling caused by thermal preference to slightly warmer and warmer conditions was substantially reduced from 33 to 9\%. No changes in perceived air-staleness or self-reported alertness and ability to concentrate occurred either, indicating parity across the no fan and fan conditions. Although occupants primarily relied on ceiling fans at the 26.5 °C setpoint, they were by default on at the beginning of each day, giving less incentive to use the desk fans. Our study took place in a high-performance Zero Energy building, whereby thermal dissatisfaction was already low (7\%). Therefore, notable changes did not occur, but significant improvements to thermal comfort could still occur in buildings that are unable to maintain high levels of thermal satisfaction.},

            Thermal discomfort is one of the main triggers for occupants’ interactions with components of the built environment such as adjustments of thermostats and/or opening windows and strongly related to the energy use in buildings. Understanding causes for thermal (dis-)comfort is crucial for design and operation of any type of building. The assessment of human thermal perception through rating scales, for example in post-occupancy studies, has been applied for several decades; however, long-existing assumptions related to these rating scales had been questioned by several researchers. The aim of this study was to gain deeper knowledge on contextual influences on the interpretation of thermal perception scales and their verbal anchors by survey participants. A questionnaire was designed and consequently applied in 21 language versions. These surveys were conducted in 57 cities in 30 countries resulting in a dataset containing responses from 8225 participants. The database offers potential for further analysis in the areas of building design and operation, psycho-physical relationships between human perception and the built environment, and linguistic analyses.},
