## Getting Started

To get started with running the code locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
    cd repository-name
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   It is recommended to use `pipenv` for managing the virtual environment and dependencies. Run the following command to install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pipenv install
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    pipenv shell
    ```

4. **Run the main script:**

   Execute the `main.py` file to perform the data analysis and generate the figures:

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Additional Information

### Dependencies

The dependencies are listed in the `Pipfile` file and can be installed using `pipenv install`.

### Data

The `data/` directory contains the datasets required for the analysis. 

- The original ASHRAE thermal comfort database II is stored in the `Data/db_measurements_v2.1.0.csv.gz` file.
- The subset of the ASHRAE thermal comfort database II used in the analysis is stored in the `Data/db_analysis.pkl.gz` file.
- The metadata of the ASHRAE thermal comfort database II is stored in the `Data/db_metadata.csv` file.

### Figures and Results

The figures generated by the `main.py` script will be saved in the `Manuscript/src/figures/` directory. 
These figures are used in the manuscript to illustrate the results of the analysis.
