    \begin{abstract}
        The \ac{pmv} model developed by Fanger predicts thermal sensation.
    %    It is used in its original formulation in the \gls{iso}, while the \gls{ashrae} uses a modified version \acs{pmv-ce} to better account for air speeds.
        We compared their results against XXX thermal sensation votes collected in buildings.
