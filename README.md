# Repository of the paper

> Manuscript title: **

The Python source code we used to generate the Figures, Tables and analyse the data can be found in the `main.py` file.

The dataset we used is located inside the `Data` folder. 
`DatabaseI&II_20180703.csv` contains all the entries in the ASHRAE Comfort Database II, while the `DBII_preprocessed.csv` contains the dataset we used in our paper.

If you want to run our code first install the dependencies using `pipenv` by running the command `pipenv install`. Subsequently you can run the `main.py` file.
